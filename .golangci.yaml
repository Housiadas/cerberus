  # The mode used to evaluate relative paths.

  # The value can be:
  # - `gomod`: the paths will be relative to the directory of the `go.mod` file.
  # - `gitroot`: the paths will be relative to the git root (the parent directory of `.git`).
  # - `cfg`: the paths will be relative to the configuration file.
  # - `wd` (NOT recommended): the paths will be relative to the place where golangci-lint is run.

  # If set, we pass it to "go list -mod={option}". From "go help modules":
  # If invoked with -mod=readonly, the go command is disallowed from the implicit
  # automatic updating of go.mod described above. Instead, it fails when any changes
  # to go.mod are needed. This setting is most useful to check that go.mod does
  # not need updates, such as in a continuous integration and testing system.
  # If invoked with -mod=vendor, the go command assumes that the vendor
  # directory holds the correct copies of dependencies and ignores
  # the dependency descriptions in go.mod.
  #
  # Allowed values: readonly|vendor|mod
  # Default: ""
  modules-download-mode: vendor
  # Allow multiple parallel golangci-lint instances running.

  # allow-parallel-runners: true
  # Allow multiple golangci-lint instances running, but serialize them around a lock.
  # If false, golangci-lint exits with an error if it fails to acquire file lock on start.
  # Default: false
  # allow-serial-runners: true
  # Number of operating system threads (`GOMAXPROCS`) that can execute golangci-lint simultaneously.
